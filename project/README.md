# Web Services & Applications Project - Cosy Covers

This repository contains code and resources related to a project carried out for the Web Services & Applications module. 

## Project Overview: 

**Cosy Covers** is a personal library management system that allows users to manage their own collection of books. Built with Flask, this project aims to provide a foundation for creating, reading, updating, and reading book records, along with search functionality.

## Features: 

- **CRUD Operations:** Add, view, update, and delete books from your library. 
- **Search:** Filter books by title, author, or genre. 
- **User Authentication (Maybe??):** Allow multiple users to manage their personal libraries 

## Prerequisities/How to Run:
